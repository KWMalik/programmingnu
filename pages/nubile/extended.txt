### About nubile

**nubile** is a code beautification tool that automatically indents Nu code.  It can be used standalone or called from a programmer's text editor such as TextMate.

With the Nu TextMate bundle, **nubile** can be run directly from within TextMate using the Command-I key shortcut.  

**nubile** uses hooks in the Nu parser to correctly handle comments and embedded here strings. 

### Usage

**nubile** expects Nu source code on standard input and produces formatted Nu source code on standard output.  It currently accepts no options.
