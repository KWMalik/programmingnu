RandomApp is a complete Nu implementation of a classic example from Aaron Hillegass' **Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X**.  You might be in for a few surprises; it really is completely Nu.

To build it, just type "nuke" in the project directory.  Then you can run the application by double-clicking on it, or you can build and run in a single step by typing "nuke run".
