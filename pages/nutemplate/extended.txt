h3. About nutemplate

*nutemplate* evaluates Nu code embedded in text files.  Much like Ruby's *erb*, *nutemplate* is a standalone version of a general-purpose templating capability that can be embedded in Nu programs.  Special markup allows code to be included for evaluation only or for evaluation with inclusion of the evaluation results.  

*nutemplate* is a simple wrapper around the *NuTemplate* class, which is designed to be easily used from Nu or Objective-C code.  
NuTemplates have been used to generate HTML, CSS, XML, and Objective-C source code.  NuTemplates are used to publish this web site and to generate documentation in NuDoc. For more details see the "NuTemplate class documentation":/doc/classes/NuTemplate.html.

h3. Usage

*nutemplate* expects a template on standard input and generates the template expansion on standard output.
