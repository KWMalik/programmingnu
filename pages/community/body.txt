# Community

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to Nu so far!

The Nu source code is hosted on [github](http://github.com/timburks/nu) and so is the [source material for this web site](http://github.com/timburks/programmingnu).

Along with that, there are several other Nu-related projects on github. Just [search github for "nu"](http://github.com/search?q=nu) to see them.

Here are some blogs and posts that discuss Nu.

* Tim Burks: [Tim's blog](http://blog.neontology.com).

* Patrick Thomson: [ImportantShock](http://importantshock.wordpress.com/category/nu), Patrick's blog with many posts about Nu.
	
* Grayson Hansard: [Grayson's blog posts about software development](http://www.fromconcentratesoftware.com/category/developer)
