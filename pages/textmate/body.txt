# A Bundle for TextMate Users

You can get the Nu TextMate bundle via the **nutmbundle** command line tool which should have been installed when you installed Nu. Running this command will fetch the bundle and install it. Using this tool assumes that you have [Git](http://git.or.cz/) installed.

Optionally, if you're the do-it-yourself type, visit [Github](http://github.com/jsallis/nu-tmbundle) for instructions on installing the bundle manually.
