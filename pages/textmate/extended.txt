
## Make your Nu code more readable with syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is available for your Nu source code, making your development experience a little easier to manage. Easily scan your code for method declarations, Nuke tasks, and more!

## Run your code without leaving TextMate

The Command-R command will cause TextMate to evaluate the Nu code in the current window using **nush**, the Nu shell and display the results in a new window. This is a great way to incrementally build and test components and **nush** scripts.

Additionally, you can use the Shift-Command-R command to run the Nu test case in the current window via **nutest**.

## Automatically reformat your code

Another useful command included in the bundle is Ctrl-Shift-H, which runs **nubile** to automatically reformat and indent your Nu code.

## Insert code via snippets

Snippets are included to make inserting commonly used code much easier. Snippets are included to insert:

* Flow of control statements such as `if`, `case`, and `cond`
* Commonly used commands such as `load` and `parse`
* Class and method declarations
* Nukefile tasks
* And many more!

## A community effort
