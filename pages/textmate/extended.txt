
h2. Automatically indent your code with a command key

The most important addition in the bundle is Command-I, which runs *nubile* to automatically indent your Nu code.  You can also use Command-I on C and Objective-C code; the Nu TextMate bundle includes a prebuilt executable for *bcpp* that will automatically indent your C and Objective-C code. 

h2. Run your code with a command key

Another useful command key is Command-R, which will evaluate the Nu code in the current window using *nush*, the Nu shell.  The results are placed in a new document.  This is a great way to incrementally build and test components and *nush* scripts.

You can use TextMate's Bundle Editor to see what other Nu tricks you can now do in your favorite text editor.  The bundle includes some preliminary syntax highlighting and as-you-type automatic formatting, but both of these could use some improvement.  TextMate hackers, please dig in!
