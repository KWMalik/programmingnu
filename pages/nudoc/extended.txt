h3. About nudoc

The *nudoc* utility automatically extracts documentation from Objective-C headers and Nu source files.  The results are a set of html files that describe all of the classes and methods in the sources read.

Modeled on Ruby's RDoc and Apple's HeaderDoc, the goal of *nudoc* is the automatic generation of reference documentation for programs written in Nu and Objective-C.  Documentation is organized logically and without regard to a class or method's implementation language.

Currently, *nudoc* is a single 850-line Nu source file that includes parsing code, page templates, and a stylesheet. It reads both Nu and Objective-C source files and generates an index and documentation pages for each file and class.

h3. Usage

Run *nudoc* in a directory containing Nu and Objective-C source files.  Currently *nudoc* expects Nu source files to be in a directory named <code>nu</code> and Objective-C source files to be in a directory named <code>objc</code>.  Documentation is generated and placed in a new directory named <code>doc</code>.

Normally *nudoc* would be run with no options to generate a generic documentation set.  The documentation for the *Programming Nu* website is generated by running *nudoc* with the following invocation:
<pre>
% nudoc -site programming.nu
</pre>
