
h2. The Nu core

* A way to call Objective-C methods that have non-object pointer arguments. (done, see the NuPointer class)

* A way to call Objective-C methods and C functions with variadic arguments.  But I must say that I dislike them, because one of the fastest ways to crash a C program is to pass the wrong number of arguments to a variadic function, and sometimes the only way to compute the correct number of arguments is to reimplement the function itself.  NSLog, for example, is a very dangerous function to call from Nu.  If you use it to print arbitrary strings, your program will crash when your strings include "format specifiers":http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Strings/Articles/FormatStrings.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000943-DontLinkElementID_18.

* DTrace hooks for deeper introspection of Nu programs.

* A profiler for Nu.

* better Distributed Objects support: the ability to include *oneway*, *in*, *out*, *inout*, and *bycopy* type modifiers in method declarations and to create protocols at runtime. (done)

* Class variables (using the "@@" sigil).

* Support for automatically generating type signatures for NuBridgedFunctions from a given C method signature.

* More error checking, especially in individual operators. Currently Nu operators do no validation of their arguments. (Be careful!)


h2. Components

* CoreData convenience methods and migration scripts written in Nu.  (done, now let's move on to an open-source database. PostgreSQL?)

* HTTP and XMPP client and server components.  (Nunja is a cross-platform HTTP server)

* Wrappers for various web APIs.

* Graphics and data visualization libraries.

* Layout managers for nibless interface building.

* Benchmarking libraries.

* A JSON importer and exporter. (Jonathan Wight's TouchJSON looks pretty good to me).

* A Textile processor. (But honestly, now that Grayson Hansard has "ported Markdown to Nu":/posts/2007/10/10/markdown-in-nu, that's good enough for me.) 

* Class browsers.

* A Nu wrapper around the Cocoa and Carbon security libraries.

* A parser for command-line input.


h2. Examples

* Ports of Apple and other Objective-C sample code to Nu.

* More examples utilizing the Markdown and YAML frameworks; YAML exporters and importers for Address Book and iCal entries would be useful for bridging to other applications.
