First, this release contains changes that allow us to write
methods that return objects by reference.  To do so, use the new <code>(id *)</code> argument type in method declarations.  The corresponding arguments will then be bridged as instances of the NuReference class.  
See [Adam Thorsen's blog"](http://loglibrarian.blogspot.com/2007/12/nu-binding-example-fixed.html) for a great example of this; it uses Nu reference arguments to write a CoreData validation method.

This release also contains preliminary support for the BridgeSupport
files that Apple included in OS 10.5.  To use it, first load
the bridgesupport code with
  <code>(load "bridgesupport")</code>
then import any desired frameworks with the new import macro:
  <code>(import Cocoa)</code>
The reader is a quick-and-simple implementation that is not tuned for
speed, so it is probably too slow for production use.  Use it to
look up symbol values that you need as you develop your application.

Other changes include new min and max operators, an enhancement
to the "+" operator to allow string concatenation, a somewhat
less dirty hack to turn off an annoying and innocuous warning
message, and a new file "fscript.nu" that contains a function
that loads the F-Script browser from Nu (requiring F-Script,
of course).  Use <code>(fs-browse myObject)</code> to browse your favorite
objects.
