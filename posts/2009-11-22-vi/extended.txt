* To reformat the contents of your buffer with nubile, use the following command:

<pre><code>:1,$ !nubile
</code></pre>

* Syntax highlight is available with a few edits to the basic vim installation.
On my Snow Leopard system, the relevant files are in /usr/share/vim/vim72.
First, to associate Nu with the .nu file type, edit the filetype.vim file.
I added the following two lines to mine:

<pre><code>" Nu
au BufNewFile,BufRead *.nu,*.nujson             setf nu
</code></pre>

You'll also need a syntax/nu.vim file. I used syntax/scheme.vim
as a starting point and will post mine as it develops.

To enable syntax highlighting, run:

<pre><code>:syntax enable
</code></pre>

And you can selectively turn it off and on with the following:

<pre><code>:syntax on
:syntax off
</code></pre>
