Along with the "Nu git repository":http://github.com/timburks/nu, there is a growing number of Nu-related projects on "github":http://github.com.

Some of the projects that I've posted include:

* "Nunja":http://github.com/timburks/nunja, a libevent-based web server that I've tested on MacOS and Linux. 
* The "NuPagePacker":http://github.com/timburks/nupagepacker example Cocoa application.
* A "NuiPhone":http://github.com/timburks/nuiphone project containing an iPhone "Hello World" in Nu.
* "NuTcl":http://github.com/timburks/nutcl, a wrapper for John Ousterhout's Tcl interpreter. You can use it to embed Tcl in a Nu/Objective-C application and create new Tcl commands with Nu. This has also been tested on both MacOS and Linux.
* "NuMySQL":http://github.com/timburks/numysql and "NuPostgreSQL":http://github.com/timburks/nupostgresql, primitive but useable interfaces to the MySQL and PostgreSQL database systems.
* "NuYAML":http://github.com/timburks/nuyaml, Patrick Thomson's YAML-processing package.
* "NuMarkdown":http://github.com/timburks/numarkdown, Grayson Hansard's Markdown package.

Patrick has also posted "Nuki":http://github.com/patrickt/nuki, early work to build a wiki with Nu,
and Grayson recently posted "NuSmartyPants":http://github.com/grayson/nusmartypants, another text formatting package.

github is proving itself to be a great way to collaborate. Come join us!
