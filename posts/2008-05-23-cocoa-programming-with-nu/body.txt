To mark the release of the third edition of Aaron Hillegass's 
[Cocoa Programming For Mac OS X](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321503619/ref=neontologycom-20),
there is a new git repository on [github](http://github.com) to contain translated examples.
To get started, I've posted an example from one of my favorite chapters, Chapter 28 (Web Services),
and will add more over time. If you'd like to help, please do! Just fork the github repository,
add your conversions, and send me a pull request. Let's see how quickly we can get this covered!

Here's the repository: [Cocoa Programming With Nu](http://github.com/timburks/cocoa-programming-with-nu).
