Nu 2.0 is now available through a binary installer. 

See the [downloads](/downloads) page for this update to Nu.

Nu 2.0 is a simpler, smaller version that uses new
features in iOS 4.3 and Mac OS 10.7 to eliminate external dependencies
and a few internal components.

* NSRegularExpression replaces PCRE.
* imp_implementationWithBlock() is used to generate method implementations.
  Previously we used libFFI for this on MacOS and a precompiled pool of
  method handlers on iOS. Now this pool is no longer needed.
* The NuSymbolTable is now just an NSMutableDictionary.

To make it easier to add Nu as a drop-in component of iOS and Mac apps,
the source code has been combined into two files, Nu.h and Nu.m. These
are currently available in the "amalgamated" branch in the git repository,
and will likely be the primary source for Nu going forward.

Nu 2.0 is intended for systems running Mac OS 10.7 or iOS 4.3 and 
their successors. For conciseness and simplicity, support for all 
other platforms is dropped.
