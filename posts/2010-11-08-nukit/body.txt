
One of my favorite uses of Nu is for building web apps and APIs for
mobile apps. To support that, I've evolved a set of frameworks that
support serving and making HTTP requests, generating markup, 
data serialization and database access. To keep things flexible,
each framework can be built separately and is in a separate git
repository. But to make them simple to use, I've created a binary
installer that installs everything from a single package.

To get it, visit the [NuKit](/nukit) page.
