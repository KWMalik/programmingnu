
h2. Regular Expression Literals

The Nu parser now allows regular expressions to be specified with the following form:
<pre>
/regex/options
</pre>

Here "regex" is a regular expression and "options" is a string of lower-case alphabetic characters.

The available options correspond to the options available for the NuRegex class:

|  i  | case insensitive comparison |
|  s  | dot metacharacter also matches newlines |
|  x  | allow whitespaces and comments in pattern |
|  l  | lazy quantifiers become greedy and vice versa |
|  m  | caret and dollar anchors match at newlines |

For example, <code>/^f(o+)$/i</code> matches strings "fo", "FOO",
and "fooooOOOOO".  

To include forward slashes in regular expressions, prefix each forward slash with a backslash.

h2. Character Literals

Character literals are single characters or escape sequences
enclosed in pairs of single quotes (').  The same escape
sequences are supported for character literals and strings.
Internally, a character literal is represented by an NSNumber
with the appropriate unicode value.  This is the same value
and type that is returned by the NSString characterAtIndex:
method.
