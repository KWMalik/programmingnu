
## Regular Expression Literals

The Nu parser now allows regular expressions to be specified with the following form:
<pre>
/regex/options
</pre>

Here "regex" is a regular expression and "options" is a string of lower-case alphabetic characters.

The available options correspond to the options available for the NuRegex class:

<table>
<tr><td>  i  </td><td> case insensitive comparison </td></tr>
<tr><td>  s  </td><td> dot metacharacter also matches newlines </td></tr>
<tr><td>  x  </td><td> allow whitespaces and comments in pattern </td></tr>
<tr><td>  l  </td><td> lazy quantifiers become greedy and vice versa </td></tr>
<tr><td>  m  </td><td> caret and dollar anchors match at newlines </td></tr>
</table>

For example, <code>/^f(o+)$/i</code> matches strings "fo", "FOO",
and "fooooOOOOO".  

To include forward slashes in regular expressions, prefix each forward slash with a backslash.

## Character Literals

Character literals are single characters or escape sequences
enclosed in pairs of single quotes (').  The same escape
sequences are supported for character literals and strings.
Internally, a character literal is represented by an NSNumber
with the appropriate unicode value.  This is the same value
and type that is returned by the NSString characterAtIndex:
method.
