
See the [downloads](/downloads) page for this long-overdue update to Nu.

The most visible change in this release is that the **macro** operator 
has been switched to refer to **macro-1** 
instead of **macro-0** (the original
Nu macro facility). That is deprecated but kept for compatibility. 

We've also been making good progress running Nu on Linux-based systems.
Currently a few small sites (including Tim's [blog](http://neontology.com) 
are running with Nu on Rackspace Cloud Servers. See notes/DEBIANINSTALL in the
Nu source distribution for details about building for Debian.
