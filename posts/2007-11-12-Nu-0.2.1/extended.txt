### Improvements

* Syntax highlighting in the TextMate bundle is much improved.  

* Grayson's Hansard's NuMarkdown processor now correctly passes all of the tests in John Gruber's Markdown test suite.  This is an exact character-for-character match.  To help with this, I added a new method to NSArray, **eachInReverse:**, which iterates over the array elements from the last to the first.  

* Brian Chapados' **sortedArrayUsingBlock:** method has been added to NSArray.

* Blocks and functions can now be defined to accept variable numbers of arguments.  To do this, the last parameter in the parameter list should begin with an asterisk; this name (including the asterisk) will be bound to a list of remaining arguments when the block is evaluated.  That list can be nil if no additional arguments are specified.  For example, the following function returns a list constructed from its variably numbered arguments:

<pre>
(function my-list (*args)
  *args)
</pre>

* Changes to support MacPorts builds have been merged.

* As requested, nuke now terminates on build errors.

* There's a new example program (MailDemo) that shows how you can use Nu to create Cocoa bindings.

* There's a new '%' operator for the integer mod function.

### Remaining problems

* The NuAnywhere program is broken on Leopard.

* Builds on Leopard generate a number of deprecation warnings.  Patrick Thomson has been working on fixes for them which will be merged into an upcoming release.

* The arithmetic operators are underpowered.  Currently they coerce their operands to doubles and don't do anything reasonable for strings.  An improvement is in the works.

### OS 10.4 support

This release was built on Mac OS 10.4 and was tested on both Mac OS X Tiger (10.4) and Leopard (10.5).  While future versions may still be buildable on Tiger, this is likely to be the last binary release that supports Tiger.  

If you have a Nu application that requires Tiger support, contact me via email and we can arrange something.  Otherwise, the next release of Nu (0.3.0) will be Leopard-only.
