See the [downloads](/downloads) page for this update to Nu.

This version mainly adds community-contributed updates:

* math-related enhancements from Brian Chapados and Issac Trotts.
* an OCaml-style pattern matching macro from Issac Trotts.
* nuke improvements from Jason Sallis.
* behind-the-scenes cleanup by Elizabeth Kellner to support Apple's Objective-C Garbage Collector. Garbage collection is not supported in the release build, but is available with a small change in the Nukefile in Nu builds from source.
