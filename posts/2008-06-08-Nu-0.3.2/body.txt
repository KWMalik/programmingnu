Here's a quick update that makes it easier for newcomers to get the latest Nu.
With this version, all of the examples in the
[Cocoa Programming with Nu](http://github.com/timburks/cocoa-programming-with-nu)
repository should work, plus there are many other small enhancements
detailed in the [commit logs](http://github.com/timburks/nu/commits).

Available on the [downloads](/downloads) page.
