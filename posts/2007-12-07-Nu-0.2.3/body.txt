I keep saying "this is the last 10.4 release", but this set of changes wasn't quite big enough to call 0.3.0, and I wanted to get it out so that I could share a few more things that I'll post soon.  Nu-0.2.3 is available on the downloads page.  It is a universal binary that was built on 10.4(Intel) and tested on 10.4(Intel) and 10.5(Intel).
