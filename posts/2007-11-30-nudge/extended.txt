"Nudge":http://nudge.neontology.com is an issue tracker that I am writing to manage my Nu projects.  I also intend to integrate it closely with git.  But right now, it's just a place where I can keep my todo list for Nu.  It's a build-as-we-go project manager for Nu.

I've put the source code online at "code.neontology.com":http://code.neontology.com.  Use it as a reference if you want to try to build your own web apps with Nu, or dig in and start helping me build Nudge into a full-featured project management system for git users.  Either way, it's there, and it's released under the same license as Nu.
