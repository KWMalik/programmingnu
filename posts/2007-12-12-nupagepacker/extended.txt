
You can download the application from this link: [NuPagePacker.dmg](/files/NuPagePacker.dmg).  It's a universal binary that includes Nu as a private framework.  

See my blog for [more details](http://blog.neontology.com/posts/2007/12/12/the-pagepacker-challenge) and look for the source in my git archives at [code.neontology.com](http://code.neontology.com).  Build the shippable disk image with "nuke dmg".  Just be sure to have Nu-0.2.4 or later installed when you build it.
